### Training-Serving Skew Definition
Training-serving skew is a difference between performance during training and performance during serving. This skew can be caused by:
* A discrepancy between how you handle data in the training and serving pipelines.
* A change in the data between when you train and when you serve.
* A feedback loop between your model and your algorithm.
