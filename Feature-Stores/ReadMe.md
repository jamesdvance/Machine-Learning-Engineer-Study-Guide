### Lessons Learned working on Feathr
* Feature stores and feature management isn't a solved problem
* Having clean concepts is important to serve users
* A feature store is a device to help ML Engineers think more simply about their deployment system
* So need named concepts that resonate with users. Getting those right early on is very helpful
* Ask users upfront what they want from this system
* Entity features are the important use case in feature stores
* The idea of decoupling the artifact / entity of a feature from just code is the innovation of feature stores
	* And can be referenced in experimentation, offline, and online environments 

### Feathr vs other feature stores
* Is still ambiguity of what feature store means. Not just a database

### Real-Time Features
* Real-time features are still a work in progress for most
* Speed to experiment with real-time features is crucial for ML engineers
* Real-time feature matter most in areas like advertising
